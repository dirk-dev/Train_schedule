# Train_schedule

**Train Schedule** is a homework assignment that demonstrates data persistence through a Firebase database. For more info on Firebase, check out this link: https://firebase.google.com/. It also makes use of the Moment.js library, which is very useful for accessing and manipulating time. Moment.js is available here: https://momentjs.com/

The user enters the train name, destination, the time of the first train, and the train frequency in minutes. 

When the user enters data into **Train Schedule**, it is uploaded to a Firebase database. Submitting another train entry refreshes the data, and the calculated data (Next Arrival and Minutes Away) is updated. Refreshing the web browser will also update the data.

**Train Schedule** was coded by me, and is maintained by me.
